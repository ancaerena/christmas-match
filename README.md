<h4><strong>Statistics controls</strong></h4>
- A div that helps the user keep track of his score and time spend on the game. It registers the number of moves the user has and also the seconds he spent playing. A great way to compare between highscores with the same user or with different users if played with your family.

- The moves show up after the first 2 cards are turned, but the timer starts the moment you open the page.
<br>
- There's also a button to invite users to play the game again. The button will reset the timer and reload the page, with a brand new board. Cards are suffled each time the Play Again button is pressed.

<br>
<h4><strong>Second section</strong></h4>
- Using Christmas color theme, this section contains the game itself. A board with 16 cards, 8 images that repeat themselves. Only two images can be turned at the same time. If they match, they will stay turned and the user can move on in finding the other pairs until the full board of cards is turned. 
<br>
- The front of the cards are showing a funny Santa Claus, peeping out, like playing hide and seek, which complements the idea of the game, encouraging the user to see what hides behind that card.
<br>
- The images on the other side of the cards are fun winter themed, with snow, snowman, Christmas Tree and Christmas presents, with kids, couples and families, making everything attractive and fun to play and discover.
